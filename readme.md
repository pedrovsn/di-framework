# Java Dependency Injection Framework Example

This is a small example Java application that demonstrates a simple Dependency Injection (DI) framework. The framework supports field injection using the `@Autowired` annotation and is built using Maven and Java 20.

## Usage

To use this DI framework in your Java application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

3. Build the project to generate the necessary class files.

4. Add the generated `di-framework.jar` file to your application's classpath.

5. Define the dependencies in your application. For example:

```java
public class MyComponent {
    @Autowired
    private MessageService messageService;

    // ...
}
```

6. Initialize the DI framework in your application's entry point or initialization code. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DependencyInjector.initialize();

        // Application initialization code
    }
}
```

7. Run your application and let the DI framework handle the injection of dependencies.

## Example Application

An example application is provided in the repository's `src/main/java/com/example` directory. It demonstrates the usage of the DI framework with a simple messaging application.

To run the example application, execute the `Main` class in your Java IDE or via the command line:

```
java com.example.Main
```

## Dependencies

This DI framework example uses Maven for dependency management. The necessary dependencies are defined in the `pom.xml` file.
